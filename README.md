# Simon Game

This is my web-based version of the classic Simon memory game, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Features

- Fully responsive design: works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Sound effects for each color button
- Animated button presses
- Level progression and game over feedback

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors and sounds.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. The sequence gets longer with each level. Try to remember as much as you can!
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end and you can restart by pressing any key.
